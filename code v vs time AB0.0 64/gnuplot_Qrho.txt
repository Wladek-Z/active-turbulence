in gnuplot, to see the density superimposed with the director field pattern (should have voids at defects), you can use

to see plot of orientational order parameter (magnitude of orientational order)

The file Qtensor.txt contains information about Q tensor, director field, density field and velocity field (to get familiar with the format you can look at the output function streamfile)
